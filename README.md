# Crwn-Clothing

Crwn-Clothing is a test Ecommerce site that was built through a Udemy course using React.

This repo is meant to be used through the deployed url. You can clone it to look at the code but would need to set up a firebase account and a Stripe account for the API key. Create an account or just explore the catalog. Add items to your cart and simulate a checkout with a test credit card.


## Usage

```
Explore the catalog and add items to your cart.
